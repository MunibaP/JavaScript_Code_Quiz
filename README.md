# JavaScript_Code_Quiz

## Description
In this week challenge #4, as a transitional web developer I was tasked to build a timed coding quiz featuring multiple-choice questions. This quiz application operates within the browser, showcasing HTML and CSS that dynamically update through the JavaScript code. The aim is to deliver a user-friendly experience with a polished and responsive interface.

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz

WHEN I click the start button

THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

WHEN I answer a question

THEN I am presented with another question

WHEN I answer a question incorrectly

THEN time is subtracted from the clock

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0

THEN the game is over

WHEN the game is over

THEN I can save my initials and my score

## Technologies
The technologies I used in this challenge includes:
1. HTML: template working HTML file was created that structures the basic layout of the coding quiz screen, time and the button.
2. CSS: template working CSS was created which included the styling of the coding quiz application..
3. Github: Gibhub was used to create a repository which includes the links to the projects, assets folder, and the README file.
4. Giblab: Giblab was used to clone the project to our laptop.

## Installation

To install the challenge #4, first create a new repository in your GitHub account, and then clone this repository to your local computer.

To clone: git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git

## Deployment

1. Deploy your code by running "git add", "git commit", and "git push" in your local repository.

2. Visit your GitHub repository online, click 'Settings', and then select 'Pages' on the left.

3. In GitHub Pages, set the 'main' branch as the source and click 'Save'.

4. Access your live site at <your-github-username.github.io/your-repository-name>. For example, if your username is "lernantino" and your repo is "css-demo-site", the URL is <lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site>.
